Knowledge of Critical Theories and the Influence on LIS Graduate Studies

Building off of Schroeder and Hollister’s findings, this survey looks at a population of twelve graduate students in Dominican University’s Library and Information Science program and how their background knowledge in critical theories informs their graduate studies. The purpose was to better understand their familiarity with critical theories and if they thought the inclusion of such theories in LIS was/would be valuable. Critical theories typically play a large part in academia, especially in the realm of Humanities. Library and Information Science has the potential to incorporate more of these theories into coursework and publications. The purpose is to explore how familiar graduate students are with different critical theories based on their undergraduate educations, if they make efforts to include what they have learned in current work, and if there is an interest to pursue further learning in that regard.

The Library and Information profession did not employ critical approaches to their field until the 1970s. Since then, more LIS professionals have called for and written about including critical theories and practices in the broader scope of librarianship. In 2014, Robert Schroeder and Christopher V. Hollister published the results to their survey entitled “Librarians’ Views on Critical Theories and Critical Practices”. The purpose of their survey was to gauge practicing librarians’ familiarity with critical theories and how that might inform library practice. They divided the survey into those who had some familiarity with the critical theories and those who did not and found that, of those who were familiar, “more than two-thirds…learned about critical theory in college, with only 14 percent encountering it in a library science course.”

The study was conducted via online survey through anonymous Google Forms. The survey was distributed to participants along with other surveys through the Canvas platform as part of coursework of the 2020 Summer Semester of Dominican University’s Library and Information Science’s 708-02 class. The survey was comprised of five open-ended questions with a brief explanation of critical theories in case of unfamiliarity. This explanation was as follows:
“The next five questions focus on an area of study often referred to as critical theories. In brief, critical theory is a tradition of interrogating structures of thought, culture, and society, typically of the Western world and usually through the lens of an oppressed group. Some examples include Feminism, Marxism, Critical Race Theory, etc.”
Respondents were encouraged to write in complete sentences and expand upon their answers to the best of their ability. The time commitment for this specific survey was estimated to be around 10 to 15 minutes.
