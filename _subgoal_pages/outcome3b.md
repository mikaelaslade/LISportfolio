### **Data Analysis and Findings Report** ###
This assignment was the culminating project for LIS 708: Evidence-based Planning, Management, and Decision-Making. In this course, we spent a lot of time learning about good research practices, design, measurement, and data collection and analysis used in library and information settings. For the project, I designed and implemented a study conducted via online survey through anonymous Google Forms. This survey looked at a population of twelve graduate students in Dominican Universityâ€™s Library and Information Science program and how their background knowledge in critical theories informs their graduate studies. The purpose was to better understand their familiarity with critical theories and if they thought the inclusion of such theories in LIS was/would be valuable. I then took those survey results and interpreted them into a basic analysis. A survey is a common tool for data collection in LIS and I was glad for the opportunity to develop and utilize my own.
