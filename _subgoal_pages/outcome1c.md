### **Digital Content Coordinator for the CRTcollective** ###
From June to December 2022, I worked for the CRTcollective, a group of archivists, librarians, scholars & activists combining critical race theory, education & information to transform scholarship & practice. I assisted with creating, managing, and scheduling social media content as well as emailing, scheduling, and promoting guest contributors for the CRTc's new podcast and blog. 

Through this work, I interacted with many LIS professionals both within the collective and while managing CRTc's Twitter and Instagram accounts. I became aware of the many organizations, groups, and conferences that exist within the LIS world. For instance, I reached out to Jennifer Ferretti, the founder of We Here, which is a space for BIPOC information professionals to learn and support one another. She became a guest on CRTc's podcast "The Organic Intellectuals", which I helped to promote on our social media. Additionally, some of CRTc's members live in the UK and so the collective has tried to take a more international approach to its work. This has allowed me to learn more about how libraries and archives operate outside of the United States. 

For this artifact, I created a PowerPoint to showcase some of the responsibilities and work I have done as part of the CRTcollective.
