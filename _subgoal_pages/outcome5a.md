### **Gamification in Libraries** ###
In LIS 707: Leadership, Marketing, and Strategic Communication, I wrote a midterm paper about a marketing topic that could be applied to LIS. I chose the topic of gamification/game-based learning because it's something I wanted to learn more about. I think games are a great tool for teaching and that's why game-based learning is gaining traction in a variety of industries- including libraries. Libraries are actively seeking ways to increase engagement among its users and demonstrate relevancy to the community. Modern day technology users expect convenience and usually have many options on where to obtain information and where to spend their time. As more and more library programming and services move online, the demand for successful user experience and interaction grows too. Gamification or game-based learning (a term that will be addressed later) could especially benefit the instruction/education role of libraries by improving learning tactics.
