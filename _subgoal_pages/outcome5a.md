### **Action Research Proposal** ###
For the final assignment in LIS 708: Evidence Based Planning, Management, and Decision Making we were required to prepare an action research proposal about a specific institution or program based in reality. According to the description, we were asked to "describe and provide a rationale for 1) the inquiry questions, 2) data needs and source(s), 3) methodology, and 4) timeline".

I chose to build off my experience of working at Dominican University’s Rebecca Crown Library as a Graduate Reference Assistant. During that time, I helped patrons navigate the combination OPAC (Online Public Access Catalog) and website to locate materials. I noticed that a lot of patrons had the same complaints and so for my Action Research Proposal I proposed an evaluation to improve Dominican’s website for increased user accessibility and confidence.
