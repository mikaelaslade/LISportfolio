This was a hypothetical exercise in creating a project for a prospective employer's organization using Design Thinking principles. Stated simply, my idea was to design and create a library orientation tutorial for first time and possibly current cardholders. The purpose of such a tutorial is to help patrons better understand library policies and navigate the library website. I imagined that I was applying for a position as Circulation Manager at my former employer, Salt Lake City Public Library, since I could build off my personal observations and knowledge of the institution while introducing new knowledge learned from the course. I outlined an incentivized, interactive tutorial that would walk users through the website. Additionally, I sketch out an assessment plan and possibilities for measurable outcomes. Since this proposed project revolves around user-testing, I suggested task-based testing as a testing plan which involves asking users to complete tasks on the website and observing their movements. I think this is a good example of a project that could be implemented in a real-world setting and have long-term, measurable results.
