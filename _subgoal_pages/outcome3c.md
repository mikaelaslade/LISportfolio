### **Action Research Proposal** ###
For the final assignment in LIS 708: Evidence Based Planning, Management, and Decision Making we were required to prepare an action research proposal about a real-world institution or program. According to the description, we were asked to "describe and provide a rationale for 1) the inquiry questions, 2) data needs and source(s), 3) methodology, and 4) timeline".

I chose to build off my experience of working at Dominican University’s Rebecca Crown Library as a Graduate Reference Assistant. During that time, I helped patrons navigate the combination OPAC (Online Public Access Catalog) and website to locate materials. I noticed that a lot of patrons had the same complaints and so for my Action Research Proposal I proposed an evaluation to improve Dominican’s website for increased user accessibility and confidence. I also built off of previous research and suggested that Dominican University look to other library groups that have utilized UX principles. UX (User Experience) is of growing interest in the Library and Information Science field, especially in academic libraries. The University of Tennessee at Chattanooga began User Testing their patron-facing website in Fall 2017 and have continued their tests twice a year, focusing on more specific areas of the website to improve as they have continued. From Fall 2016 to 2018, Penn State University (PSU) Libraries set up an unannounced stand in their main lobby and dubbed it the UX Café. Testers offered participants snacks and coffee in exchange for their survey time. The ultimate goal was to implement small, iterative changes to the website over time. 

Not all university library websites have to be the same but there are benefits to comparing strategies in addition to conducting user testing. I proposed that Dominican should implement task-based testing because it can produce both quantitative and qualitative results. It can also be both efficient and cost-effective. My hypothesis was that RCL could find many areas in their website ready for improvement. Just from first glance and comparison to the websites observed earlier in this proposal, Dominican’s library website was quite text heavy. Additionally, the other websites had the “Ask Us” button on the side and follow the user as they scrolled instead of being pinned to the top.
