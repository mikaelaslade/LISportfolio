### **The Ethics and Practices of U.S. Prison Libraries** ###
For my final project for LIS 701, we were instructed to write a research paper on a core professional value or ethic in the LIS profession. I chose to examine the tension between standards set by the American Library Assoication and the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions and the difficulties in upholding them in American prison systems. I examine the professional ethic of intellectual freedom that is often unrealized in U.S. prison libraries.
