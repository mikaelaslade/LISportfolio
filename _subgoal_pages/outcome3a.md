### **Site Prototyping/Wireframing** ###

In Spring 2020, I took LIS 786 Advanced Web Design which built off of basic Web design knowledge and required a basic understanding of HTML/CSS. During this class, we took the semester to design and create a website using GitHub (a cloud-based website hosting service that stores and manages code) and Jekyll (a blog-aware, static site generator in Ruby). I used this opportunity to create a site that could fill the requirements of the MLIS e-portfolio, which is what you are looking at now. The artifact is this website but I am also including a wireframe sketch that I created at the beginning of the process to give a general idea of what the website might look like. The purpose of this sketch was to quickly brainstorm designs and serve as a roadmap for future development. The site has changed since the first iteration but that is typical for such a project and is part of the iterative process of design.
