### **Schema Report** ###
I researched the history, significance, and use of two different metadata schemas for LIS882: Metadata for Digital Collections. The two metadata schemas I researched were Encoded Archival Description (EAD) and Public Broadcasting Core (PBCore). EAD was a response to the growth of the Internet and the desire to allow online access to archival finding aids. PBCore was developed specifically for the content management and preservation needs of the Public Broadcasting industry. Each of these schemas were created with specific needs and communities in mind and continue to evolve with those groups to fit changing needs and technologies. In this artifact, I cover the history, significance, and usage of these two schemas. This project helped me realize how diverse information groups can be and why they might need different ways of organizing to fit their unique collections.
