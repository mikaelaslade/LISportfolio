### **Lesson Plan on Human-Centered Design in Libraries** ###
In LIS 702: Facilitating User Learning and Information Needs, I had the opportunity to develop a lesson plan and teach my classmates a ten minute lesson on a topic relating to the LIS program's foundational classes. I chose to focus on human-centered design and the design thinking process because more libraries are using design-based principles to better connect with their users. We were taught how to create a lesson plan and what our goals as teachers and facilitators should be. The basic steps of creating a lesson plan are:
1. Recognize the student need
2. Describe and analyze the present situation, including available resources
3. Develop instructional goals and expected learning outcomes
4. Design methods and/or materials 
5. Deliver the instruction 
6. Evaluate and Revise

I used this process for my presentation, which I have attached below. The artifact link shows a detailed explanation of the topic, a script of the presentation, and a description of the ACRL framework I utilized. The Association of College & Research Libraries has identified six key frames for information literacy and is a useful teaching tool, especially within LIS.
