### **Group Report and Metadata Collection** ###
In LIS 882, I was assigned to a group and asked to work collaboratively to develop a metadata application profile. We were responsible for creating an imaginary group and collection to which we would each contribute a photograph. According to the assignment description, "Group members must work together to create xml records, a metadata application profile for the digital collection, and a group report documenting decisions made and issues 
faced throughout the process." This assignment was quite complicated with many parts and it required a lot of communication between myself and the two other group members. Since the class was virtual, we messaged back and forth a lot in order to come to a consensus and make decisions for this project. Additionally, it was an assignment that challenged our new knowledge on a complicated subject and so it was important for the group to check each other's work for mistakes in a constructive way. The artifact is our Group Report, which we wrote together, and gives an overview of our process and choices.
