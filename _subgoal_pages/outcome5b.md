### **Embedded Librarians** ###
In LIS 702, my classmates and I were split into pairs and were asked to prepare a presentation focusing on the main points of an assigned library's embedded library program and how this idea connects to the concepts learned in the course. Gaby and I looked at [Douglas County Libraries](https://americanlibrariesmagazine.org/2012/06/13/community-reference-making-libraries-indispensable-in-a-new-way/) in Colorado for lessons on how to effectively create and maintain community reference in order to make libraries an indispensible community asset. This artifact is our presentation that we posted in our class discussion. I learned how valuable embedded librarianship can be and how well it can demonstrate that value to the broader population. Furthermore, I realized that the ways in which librarianship and reference work can manifest can be as varied and unique as the communities in which they serve.
