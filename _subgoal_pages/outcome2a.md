### **Digital Curation Plan** ###

This document was the final project for LIS 889: Digital Curation. I created an imaginary Digital Assetment Management group called the Digital Repository of the Midwest. The document goes over three different types of content that DRoM plans to curate: a science collection, humanities collection, and a digital footprint assessment. The data within each of these collections is varied and different data requires different approaches for best preservation. Data preservation and curation is not one-size fits all nor is it a single event. These digital curation plans will detail the types of files preserved and why and a plan for inventory and assessment. This is a good example of how information can vary by type, use, etc. Information professionals have to be knowledgeable about the different types and formats of data in order to determine the best strategy for use and preservation. For example,I identified many types of data in the science collection such as numerical, geological, geochemical, image, cartographic, etc. These types of information came in different formats such as text, image, PowerPoint which come with preferred formats such as pdf, jpeg or tiff, etc. This assignment helped me understand the complexities and varieties of information.
