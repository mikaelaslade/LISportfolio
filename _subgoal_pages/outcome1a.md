##LIS 775 Discussion 4##

In LIS 775 - Intro to Archival Principles, Practices, and Services, we were asked to describe two specific social, cultural, ethical, and/or legal challenges mentioned in the reading materials for a discussion post. I write about how archives must balance the privacy of the individual with the need for historical accountability and record-keeping, especially with sensitive topics and records. In the past, Native American ceremonial/funeral items or photographs depicting sacred activities have been included without much question as to the ethical implications. Yet, this is changing as archivists become more culturally sensitive. Another issue is the handling of personal records that might depict living individuals in a comprising manner. This is especially relevant in light of changing digital environments and expectations of privacy, such as the European Union's legislative actions on the "Right to Be Forgotten".
