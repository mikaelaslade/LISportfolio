### **Reflection Paper 2: The Past** ###
The purpose of this reflection paper was to apply and demonstrate mastery and/or critical thinking of the terms and theories learned in LIS 762: Critical Race Information Theory. We had recently learned about TribalCrit, an offshoot of Critical Race Theory that focuses on Indigeneous issues. I was inspired after hearing our guest speaker, Cutcha Risling Baldy, and reading the introduction of Professor Linda Tuhiwai Smith's hugely influential text, *Decolonizing Methodologies: Research and Indigenous Peoples* to reflect on the ways that the LIS profession's ideal of accessibility might be hindered by our adherence to Western, colonial values. I write, "The Western, colonial tradition of research often dismisses story-telling and oral history in favor of an objective, unbiased outside researcher. Of course, there is no such thing as an unbiased researcher and by gatekeeping and privileging certain ways of collecting and discussing knowledge, academic or professional institutions can control the ways in which we think about certain subjects." As information professionals, we must consider the many ways that information exists and can be used or abused depending on the contexts in which they exist.
