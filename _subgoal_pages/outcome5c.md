### **Peer Review** ###

Building off of outcome 5b, this artifact is from the same group assignment. We were asked to submit an Individual Report, attached below, and a Peer Review to reflect on how well we worked together. I noticed in the beginning that the group was rather uncommunicative and so I felt like I needed to take the initiative to follow up regularly to make sure that we stayed on track. It was quite difficult to make a lot of seemingly simple decisions due to wanting to receive everyone's input but receiving no answer or non-commital answers. Eventually, I realized that the most effective strategy was to make decisions and offer those decisions up for input. I took a leadership role by making decisions and delegating roles when necessary.

In the Peer Review, one of my teammates commented, "Along with this, you not only held the collaborated documents, if I’ve read the messages correctly, but you were also willing to submit the assignment for the group. The feedback that you provided showed some insight as well as helpful tips". The other commented, "Mikaela had appropriate suggestions and communicated often. I felt like she helped me a lot by giving and receiving constructive criticism. Our whole group needed to be more detailed in our communications, but once we figured that out, Mikaela’s detailed ideas became even more helpful. I enjoyed working with Mikaela." As for weaknesses, someone noticed that I seemed stressed in some of the communications and I think that was a fair assessment. I tried not to let my frustration show but when the deadline approached it became difficult to stay cool. I believe I stayed professional but I could have communicated more directly to avoid passing off my stress onto others.
