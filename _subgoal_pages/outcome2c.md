### **RM/IG Program Plan** ###
The premise of this final project for my Records Management course (LIS 886) was that I was appointed the Director of Records and Information Management for River Park University. My job was to "prepare a comprehensive program plan outlining the short- and long-term goals for a newly approved RM/IG program". I outlined my plans for the new program at 60, 90, and 120 days. An essential part of any RM/IG program is establishing a dialogue with stakeholders to determine strategic objectives that align with the instituion's mission and goals. A Records Manager must communicate with not only executive leadership but also any other groups that might be affected or involved. Oftentimes, that includes IT, administration, archives, and an institution's legal team. An RM/IG director must balance the needs of many groups while still making the best decision for the healthiest program.
