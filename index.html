      <p>When I first applied to Dominican University’s MLIS program, I was working full time as a Circulation Assistant/Passport Agent at Salt Lake City Public Library. I enjoyed my work there, but I had a lot of difficulty moving outside of my department without specific experience or education. I wanted to explore what roles the library could offer to find a position that was both challenging and rewarding. At that time, I was also eager to leave Salt Lake City, a place where I had lived since birth, and experience life outside what I had known. Living in another state had always been a dream of mine and, for me, it was important to challenge myself as well as find opportunities outside of Utah’s more limited scope. Dominican University’s MLIS program offered me a chance to do both and, by its proximity to Chicago, allowed me to learn more about a city chosen by my Polish immigrant ancestors. Of course, the pandemic interrupted my intentions of attending mostly in-person courses and experiencing Chicago in 2020-2021. I was able to complete most of my courses virtually in Chicago then Salt Lake for a year and then back in Chicago, where I am now. </p>
      <p>It's fair to say that my MLIS education did not happen the way I expected. When I first signed up for classes, I expected to pursue a User Experience SOIS certificate. I knew a couple people who had gone into UX design, and I was interested to see how it applied to LIS. A few of my artifacts center design-thinking such as 4a and 4c where I look at how design thinking can be/has been applied in specific library contexts. Goal 4 was to synthesize theory and practice within a dynamic and evolving information environment, and I found applying the theory of UX/Design principles to library environments a good way of fulfilling this goal. In 4a, I suggested using design thinking principles to design and create a library orientation tutorial for first time and possibly current cardholders as well as implementing user-testing to improve the library’s website. Artifact 4c was a lesson I created for fellow LIS students about Human-Centered Design in libraries and how it could be used for better interactions with library patrons. Libraries are becoming more tech-centric and so it makes sense to apply concepts used in the tech world to an information environment. There is a lot of overlap between the goals of a UX designer and a librarian in the fact that they both are service-oriented and need to be adaptable with change. </p>
      <p>There is also a UX influence in artifacts 3a and 3c. The third goal was to navigate, curate and create information across the spectrum of human records. For 3a, I took a Web Design course where I took the semester to design and create a website using GitHub (a cloud-based website hosting service that stores and manages code) and Jekyll (a blog-aware, static site generator in Ruby). I used this opportunity to create a site that could fill the requirements of the MLIS e-portfolio. This may sound strange, but this process helped to de-mystify web creation and coding. Coding and web design can seem overly complicated and intimidating to an outsider but with a little experience it becomes evident that, like any language or skill, it has a logic and is learnable with practice and research. I know that it gets more in-depth and complicated but knowing that most of the Internet is comprised of basic building blocks makes it more accessible and makes me more confident in using web-based tools and resources. For 3c, I chose to build off my experience of working at Dominican University’s Rebecca Crown Library as a Graduate Reference Assistant for my Action Research Proposal project.  I proposed an evaluation to improve Dominican’s website and OPAC (Online Public Access Catalog) for increased user accessibility and confidence. This type of evaluation is becoming more common in libraries, especially academic libraries, and I used this assignment to compare different academic library websites to each other and analyze how they used user research to improve. </p>
      <p>I am still interested in human-centered design and design thinking and think these concepts can offer a lot to libraries and information centers but, after taking the Web Design course, I realized that I’m less interested in the design of digital interfaces/websites and more interested in the ways design thinking can aid accessibility in other scenarios. For example, I researched gamification/game-based learning in libraries (Outcome 5a) which explored strategies that libraries use to increase engagement among its users and demonstrate relevancy to their community. While I’m grateful for the experience of designing and programming a website and learning more about UX, I found that I could not see myself in that role in the future. I think the principles of design thinking and centering the user are applicable to any service-based program and I will continue to keep in mind and advocate for those principles in the future. </p>
      <p>My interest in usability, however, has carried over into my focus on Digital Curation. I found DU’s certificate in Digital Curation as a great cross-section of many of my interests: accessibility, analysis, archives, research, etc. Digital curation has become more and more relevant in our largely digital world. More and more of our content will be born digital and how much of it will be lost due to improper preservation and maintenance? Furthermore, the concepts of digital curation are very versatile and can apply to any field that utilizes digital data. This is part of why I enjoyed my Introduction to Metadata class because I was able to see how metadata schemas and standards are used and adapted to different community needs. For outcomes 5b and 5c, I referenced a project from that class where I worked with a group to create a digital repository. We worked together to create xml records and a metadata application profile for the digital collection. It was a great exercise in teamwork as well as an exercise in knowledge organization.</p>
      <p>To me, digital curation gets at the theoretical heart of information services in the modern age. We live in a world inundated with information and data of all kinds, but it takes skill and knowledge to be able to navigate or direct others to the most relevant and correct parts. That’s why for Goal 2, “understand[ing] the essential nature of information and its relevance to society”, I included artifacts related to my digital curation courses. For 2a, I took my final project from LIS 889: Digital Curation. I created an imaginary Digital Asset Management group called the Digital Repository of the Midwest. The document goes over three different types of content that DRoM plans to curate: a science collection, humanities collection, and a digital footprint assessment. The data within each of these collections is varied and different data requires different approaches for best preservation. Data preservation and curation is not one-size fits all nor is it a single event. In a similar vein, the premise of the final project for my Records Management course was that I was appointed the Director of Records and Information Management for River Park University and my job was to “prepare a comprehensive program plan outlining the short- and long-term goals for a newly approved RM/IG program”. Through this course and project, I learned how vital records management is to the health of any organization and how essential good information organization and preservation can be. 2b I took from a discussion in my Intro to Archives course where we were asked to consider ethical or legal challenges that might arise in archival management. Handling sensitive materials and records has only become more complicated with Internet accessibility. I had never considered that there may be sensitive records that are being held in archives but purposefully not included in online collections for a various number of reasons. Additionally, in this course we talked about the EU’s legislative actions around citizen privacy like “Right to Be Forgotten” and in Records Management, we went over the implications of the EU’s GDPR. The balance between privacy, accessibility, and accountability is an important part of an information professionals’ role, especially concerning digital materials. </p>
      <p>This leads into the final thread which is where I explored some of the social and ethical responsibilities and issues within the LIS discipline. I did this through my coursework, which is best seen in the artifacts for Goal 1. Outcome 1b was my final project for LIS 701, one of my first classes. We were asked to examine a core value/ethic within LIS, and I wanted to explore an issue that I wanted to understand better, which was prison libraries. I chose to examine the tension between standards set by the American Library Association and the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions and the difficulties in upholding them in American prison systems. It was an overwhelming topic, and I did not do it justice within the limited scope of the paper but my most important takeaway was the existence of gaps between the professional standards and reality such as valuing intellectual freedom for all but having to compromise these values within a carceral system. Outcome 1a’s artifact was a Reflection Paper completed for the newly introduced course on Critical Race Information Theory. This course allowed me to build off my interest in critical theories (as seen in Outcome 3b) while learning more specifically about racial justice issues within the information sphere. </p>
      <p>This course also led me to my association with the CRTcollective, which has been such a highlight of my education and work experience. After completing Dr. Tony Dunbar’s LIS course “Critical Race Information Theory”, he approached me with a part-time job opportunity with the CRTc, a collective of information professionals dedicated to educating and discussing Critical Race Theory within an informational context. The job was to help with creating, managing, and scheduling social media content and reach out/schedule guest contributors for podcast and blog. I had never managed social media beyond my own and I thought it would be a unique and valuable learning experience. Of course, I have learned more about how professional organizations use social media to interact with others and promote their work but some of my most valuable lessons came with realizing how many hard-working professionals take their own time and energy to work for causes they are passionate about. There are so many organizations, groups, and individuals that are dedicated to racial justice, and I found it very inspiring. I hope that I can continue to be involved in equity work in my future, whether through my career or on my own. </p>
      <p>Hopefully, through this reflection I have shown what I have learned and how I have developed my professional identity. While creating my e-portfolio and reflecting on my experiences in DU’s MLIS program, I have identified three main threads that reflect my professional interests and identity. First, is an interest in usability and the application of the design thinking process. Second, is an academic focus on digital curation principles. Finally, is the continual interest in social and ethical responsibilities within the Library and Information Science field.  This program helped me to develop skills and allowed me to discover and hone my interests. It is because of my decision to pursue the Digital Curation SOIS certificate, that I am now looking at jobs as a metadata librarian. When I first entered the program, I had no idea what direction I wanted my career to go. I knew that I valued libraries but had no skills outside of my work in the circulation department at a public library. I am now hopeful that I will be able to find a position where I can incorporate my interests and skills into a rewarding career.</p>
