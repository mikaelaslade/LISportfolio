      <p><strong>Reflective Essay</strong></p>
      <p>When I first applied to Dominican University’s MLIS program, I was working full time as a Circulation Assistant/Passport Agent at Salt Lake City Public Library. I enjoyed my work there, but I had a lot of difficulty moving outside of my department without specific experience or education. I wanted to explore what roles the library could offer to find a position that was both challenging and rewarding. At that time, I was also eager to leave Salt Lake City, a place where I had lived since birth, and experience life outside what I had known. Living in another state had always been a dream of mine and, for me, it was important to challenge myself as well as find opportunities outside of Utah’s more limited scope. Dominican University’s MLIS program offered me a chance to do both and, by its proximity to Chicago, allowed me to learn more about a city chosen by my Polish immigrant ancestors. Of course, the pandemic interrupted my intentions of attending mostly in-person courses and experiencing Chicago in 2020-2021. I was able to complete most of my courses virtually in Chicago then Salt Lake for a year and then back in Chicago, where I am now. </p>
